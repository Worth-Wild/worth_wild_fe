Predation, pesticide use, irrigation practices, and lack of genetic diversity may also limit the abundance of Wyoming toads in the Laramie Basin (USFWS 2015).

Adults are more aquatic than other toad species in California and prefer habitats with short plant cover and unobstructed access to still or slowly flowing water (Schuierer and Anderson 1990). Breeding occurs in shallow marsh and pond waters (Schuierer and Anderson 1990). In winter, the toads retreat to rodent burrows or other refuges.",
                  "threat_impact_comments": "\"Kagarise Sherman (1980) noted tadpole mortality associated with water diversion and a low level of adult mortality presumably caused by cattle trampling. In response, Deep Springs College abandoned irrigation ditch maintenance and related agricultural practices (e.g., raking and burning) that were potentially detrimental to the toads. Cattle exclosures were built around the spring sources in the early 1970s, presumably to protect toad hibernacula from disturbance.\" (Murphy et al. 2003). Since then, Deep Springs College has abandoned all agricultural practices within black toad habitat, except periodic cattle grazing (Murphy et al. 2003). Cattle exclosures and other areas at Corral Springs have become thickly vegetated; the impact of this on the toads deserves further study (Murphy et al. 2003). Trampling by cattle occurred at Antelope Spring in at least the 1970s.<br><br>In addition to habitat concerns, potential threats include chytridiomycosis and introduction of non-native species such as bullfrogs. The small range of the species makes it highly vulnerable to sudden declines that could occur with the introduction of a non-native predator or disease (Fellers 2005). <br><br>These toads appear to tolerate periodic droughts and other climate variations (Schuierer 1972) and so may not be highly vulnerable to climate change unless it results in significant reductions in spring outflows.<br><br>Excessive collecting by herpetologists may have been a threat in the early 1970s (Schuierer 1972).",
